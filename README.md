This is my Personal Portfolio Website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements.
It includes sections like Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact for easy navigation.
The design is fully responsive and works smoothly on desktop and mobile devices.
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (customized with modern tools) to build this site.
Deployed on GitHub Pages, this portfolio serves as my online professional identity.
